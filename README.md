# Student-mark-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The project predicts student performance (Pass/Fail) using Machine Learning based on study hours, attendance, and previous marks. It uses Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and model training, with a Tkinter GUI for easy real-time prediction.
